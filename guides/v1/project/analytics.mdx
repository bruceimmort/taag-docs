## Eyes on numbers

Once your project is live and people start visiting, or subscribing your pricing page, you will want to know how it is going.

Head over to the **Analytics tab** of your project in the upper navigation, and you’ll land here:

> To access the analytics, [add a plan](../plan/new) if you haven't created any pricing plan or if you are seeing a page like this :

Lat's continue, from the start you will see a chart with:
- **Impressions**: everyone that reached on your page
- **Revenue**: the numbers that matter.
- **Conversion rates**: views turning into money
- **Subscribers (by location)**: because it’s important to know if someone in Sweden or Brazil loves your product.

## Go deeper

Want to explore even more? Hover over the chart to see the time periods or the map to watch number of views, subscribers and conversion rates (in a specific country around the globe).

Maybe one pricing plan is outperforming the others. Or users from Europe are converting more. Analytics helps you structure your strategy.
