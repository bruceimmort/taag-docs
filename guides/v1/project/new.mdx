## From scratch

When you are done with creating your account, you come to this empty dashboard.

You see the big blue **"Add project"** button (yeah, the obvious one) ? Click it to bring your project to life.

## Project form

This is your project's form, no pressure !! Just one field to fill

![New Project Form](/imgs/project-form.png)

Only **project name** here is needed nothing else, so give your project a name, and that’s all.

Once you hit **"Create project"** button, your dashboard will go from empty to page with all your projects:

Your projects will be appearing as cards, you can click on any project to see your subscribers, manage pricing plans and rules, and keep an eye on how things are going.

## What's next?

Now that your project is alive, it is time to set it's pricing plans. You’ll decide the cost, and who they are for.
