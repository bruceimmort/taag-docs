## Manage paying users

So you've launched your project, added your pricing plans and now you want to know who is actually subscribing. Go to **subscribers** tab in your navigation.

When you first open it, it's pretty quiet.

No worries once users start paying, you will be able to see them and their countries.

## What you will see

Once users start paying, youâ€™ll see:

- Who is paying 
- Where they are from (countries)
- What plan they chose

This helps you understand your audience and adjust your pricing if needed.
