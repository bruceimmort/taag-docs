## Project settings

This is where your project quietly holds its most important information.

Each project comes with two keys:

- **Public Key**  
  Use this in your frontend (browser). It's safe to expose and it tells the system which project is being used.

- **Secret Key**  
  This one is private. Never share it, only meant for your server/backend.

## Deleting project

See that **"Permanently Delete"** button at the bottom?

![Project Settings Page](/imgs/delete-project-btn.PNG)

Click it + confirm again on the same button to **remove your project forever** keys, plans, subscribers, everything. 

<Warning> 
    Unless you are sure that you are done with it that is when you can delete the project. 
    There is no undo.
