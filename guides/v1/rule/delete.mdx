title: "Delete rule"
---

This is getting interesting so far âœ¨

## Why edit?

Now what if you have a rule you no longer need, and now you have to remove it ? It is just simple, as we already did, click one of the plans you want to delete its rule:

![Empty Dashboard](/imgs/plans-page.png)

And hover on the country or continent rule you want to delete, you will notice these 2 icons:

![Empty Dashboard](/imgs/rules-option.png)

And all you have to do is just click the one with trash icon and the rule willbe removed.

<Warning> Warning: This action of deleting the pricing rule is irreversible. Make sure you do it only if needed.</Warning>
