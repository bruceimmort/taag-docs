title: "Edit rule"
---

Welcome once again... I hope until now we you already have a rule for your plan.
But if you don't have any rule you don't have to worry, got your back [create a rule](./new)

## Why edit?

So now let's say you made a typo and set a price which is not thw one you wanted, we have always to simple mistakes so it is normal!
>For example, instead of setting **"3.69"** you wrote **"3.99"** for Sweden now you have to set the correct price.

Click again on the plan you already set rules for and hover (move mouse) on the country or the continent card, these two small icons will appear on the card:

Click on the one with a pencil on it (to edit) and this form will popup on your screen:

- Here you can now change the price to the correct one for that country of even continent.

Once you are done, just click on the blue **"Update rule"** button to confirm the new price.

> Reminder: Don't forget that the price is in US dollars with 2 numbers (for cents) after the dot.
