title: "New rule"

We came a long way from the start <br/><br/>
And now I believe you did create at least a plan for your project. But if you have not created any and need some help you can quickly do that just [click here](../plan) and come back after. 

## What is a rule

So now what is a **pricing rule now?** For example let's say you created a plan for your project for 6.99 USD and you want to charge people from Africa 5.99 USD for the same plan.
This is where you can set rules for different regions accodingly.

## How to add a rule

Go to the plans section on your dashboard then select one of the plan cards you want:

![Empty Dashboard](/imgs/plans-page.png)

You will immediately get this side popup to set a rule for the plan and by default it looks like this:

![Empty Dashboard](/imgs/add-rules.png)

### By regions
You have to click that blue "Set rules" button and choose by which region (by continent or by countries).
Then choose betweeen:

- **By country:** you will be able to search a country and the price you want to set for the country:

![Empty Dashboard](/imgs/country-rules.png)

- **By continent:** choose a continent and enter the price they will be seeing:

![Empty Dashboard](/imgs/continent-rules.png)

You can remove the continent or the country you added by accident by clicking a small "x" on any continent or country card.
You can also confirm the rule buy clicking the blue **"Set rule"** button... as easy as that.


<Note>Note that the price is in US dollars and you can add cents (two numbers after the dot)</Note>

### Take a look
To see all the rules you created, it is in the same way you added the rules, click the plan card and on the same side popup all the rules will appear (both by continent and country)

## Delete rule

Now what if you have a rule you no longer need, and now you have to remove it ? It is just simple, as we already did, click one of the plans you want to delete its rule:

![Empty Dashboard](/imgs/plans-page.png)

And hover on the country or continent rule you want to delete, you will notice these 2 icons:

![Empty Dashboard](/imgs/rules-option.png)

And all you have to do is just click the one with trash icon and the rule will be removed.

<Warning> Warning: This action of deleting the pricing rule is irreversible. Make sure you do it only if needed.</Warning>
