## Create pricing plan

Ready to make money from your project? If you have no plan at the moment you see a page like this:

![Empty Dashboard](/imgs/add-pricing-default.png)

Now let’s set up your first plan.

When you click that big blue **“Create pricing plan”** button, a simple form pops up:

### What to fill in:

- **Name**  
  This is how your users will recognize the offer think:  
  `Basic`, `Premium`, `Enterprise`, or `Student Special`.

- **Default price (Fallback price)**  
  The default price is in US Dollars (ex: `3.99`).  
  This fallback price is showed when:
  - No specific pricing rule matches the user's region
  - We can't detect the user's location  

Once you're done, hit the **"Create plan"** button and now your plan is live and ready.
