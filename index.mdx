## Base URL

Our pricing API is built on REST principles keeping things smooth and reliable. HTTPS is mandatory on every request. (No HTTP allowed here!)

All your requests start with this base URL:

```bash
https://taag-api.carllabs.cc
```

## Authentication

To get going, just add an Authorization header to your request. Always include your **secret key** in all server-side calls and **public key** in client-side (like browser) calls. 


**Public key** looks like this
```bash
Authorization: taag_pk_xxxxxxxxx
```

**Secret key** looks like this
```bash
Authorization: taag_sk_xxxxxxxxx
```

<Warning>
  Keep your **secret key** safe and donâ€™t share it around!
</Warning>
