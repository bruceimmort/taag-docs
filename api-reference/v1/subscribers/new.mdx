### Use case

Letâ€™s say someone just checked out and paid. Now you want to register them using this endpoint. 
You will send their `countryCode` and `ruleId`.
```bash POST
https://taag-api.carllabs.cc/v1/subscribers/new
```

### Authorization

Make sure to include the `Authorization` header with your `secret key`:

```bash
Authorization: taag_sk_xxxxxxxxx
```
### Request body
```json
{
  "countryCode": "SE",
  "ruleId": "cmb6mqodq000139dsl35qnn43"
}
```
<ResponseField name="countryCode" type="string" required> 
    The country where your subscriber is located.
</ResponseField> 

<ResponseField name="ruleId" type="string" required> 
    The pricing rule ID you used during checkout. 
    You can grab this from the response of the [get price](../pricing/get) endpoint. 
</ResponseField>

### Response

{
  "success": true,
  "subscriberId": "2d9b73d492898ebd600fbcae7b67c3a5"
