title: 'Get Price'
openapi: 'GET /pricing'

### Use case

This run on the **client side**. It’s the part that shows people appropriate prices based on their region. Let’s say someone visits your site from Sweden! You’ll get price plans that were set for Sweden.

```bash GET
https://taag-api.carllabs.cc/v1/pricing
```
---


### Authorization

All you need to use here is your `public key` as a value of `Authorization` in header:

```bash
Authorization: taag_pk_xxxxxxxxx
```

<ResponseField name="Authorization" required>
</ResponseField>

### Response

```json
{
  "mode": "LIVE",
  "countryCode": "SE",
  "plans": [
    {
      "plan": "Basic",
      "formatedPrice": "12",
      "ruleId": "cmb6mqodq002011dsl35qnn43"
    },
    {
      "plan": "Premium",
      "formatedPrice": "59",
      "ruleId": "cmb6lvyey000139dso4405sf9"
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** The `ruleId` you get here is important, you’ll use it to **verify prices** when a user picks a plan.
