title: 'Verify Price'
openapi: 'POST /pricing/verify'
---

---

### Use case
Use this endpoint when someoneâ€™s ready to pay. It double-checks the pricing rule (using the `ruleId` you got earlier from the [get price](./get) api endpoint) and returns the **actual amount** you should charge. It helps to keep things accurate.

```bash POST
https://taag-api.carllabs.cc/v1/pricing/verify
```

---

### Authorization
Make sure to include the `Authorization` header with your `secret key`:
```bash
Authorization: taag_sk_xxxxxxxxx
```

### Request body
```json
{
  "countryCode": "SE",
  "ruleId": "cmb6mqodq000139dsl35qnn43"
}
```

<ResponseField name="countryCode" type="string" required>
Include the country code where the user is in.

Example: `"US"`

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="ruleId" type="string" required>
Include the rule id on which the user is on too.

Example: `"cmb6mqodq000139dsl35qnn43"`

</ResponseField>

> Just to be clear here, use the **countryCode** and **ruleId** you got from the [get price](./get) api endpoint

### Response

{
  "countryCode": "SE",
  "price": 1200,
  "formatedPrice": "12",
