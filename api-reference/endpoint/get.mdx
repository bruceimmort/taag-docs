</ResponseField>

### Response

```json
{
  "mode": "LIVE",
  "countryCode": "SE",
  "plans": [
    {
      "plan": "Basic",
      "formatedPrice": "12",
      "ruleId": "cmb6mqodq002011dsl35qnn43"
    },
    {
      "plan": "Premium",

    }
  ]
}
```

### Use case

This run on the **client side**. It’s the part that shows people appropriate prices based on their region. Let’s say someone visits your site from Sweden! You’ll get price plans that were set for Sweden.

> **Tip:** The `ruleId` you get here is important, you’ll use it to **verify prices** when a user picks a plan.
