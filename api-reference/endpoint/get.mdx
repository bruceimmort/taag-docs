title: 'Get Price'
openapi: 'GET /pricing'
---

Fetch the price based on where your user is in the world.          
Just like that!

### Authorization

All you need to use here is to add your **public key** as a value in Authorization.

```http
Authorization: taag_pk_xxxxxxxxx
```

### Use case

This run on the **client side**. It’s the part that shows people appropriate prices based on their region.

Let’s say someone visits your site from Sweden? You’ll get prices that were set for Sweden.

### Example Response

```json
{
  "mode": "LIVE",
  "countryCode": "SE",
  "plans": [
    {
      "plan": "Basic",
      "formatedPrice": "12",
      "ruleId": "cmb6mqodq002011dsl35qnn43"
    },
    {
      "plan": "Premium",
      "formatedPrice": "59",
      "ruleId": "cmb6lvyey000139dso4405sf9"
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Tip:** The `ruleId` you get here is important — you’ll use it to **verify prices** when a user picks a plan.
