</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="ruleId" type="string" required>
Include the rule id on which the user is on too.

Example: `"cmb6mqodq000139dsl35qnn43"`

</ResponseField>

> **Note:** Just to be clear here, use the **countryCode** and **ruleId** you got from the [Get price](./get) api endpoint

### Response
```json
{
  "countryCode": "SE",
  "price": 1200,
  "formatedPrice": "12",
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

### Use case
Use this endpoint when someoneâ€™s ready to pay. It double-checks the pricing rule (using the `ruleId` you got earlier from the `GET /pricing` api endpoint) and returns the **actual amount** you should charge. It helps to keep things accurate.

> **Tip:** Always verify pricing server-side before charging to avoid manipulation from the client side.
