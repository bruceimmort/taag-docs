title: 'Verify Price'
openapi: 'POST /pricing/verify'

### What's this for?
Use this endpoint when someoneâ€™s ready to pay. It double-checks the pricing rule (using the `ruleId` you got earlier from the `GET /pricing` api endpoint) and returns the **actual amount** you should charge. It helps to keep things accurate.

<Note>
    This is a server-side call and needs your **secret key** to work. Keep it safe!
</Note>

### Authentication
Make sure to include the `Authorization` header:
```http
Authorization: taag_sk_xxxxxxxxx
```

### Example Request
```json
{
  "countryCode": "SE",
  "ruleId": "cmb6mqodq000139dsl35qnn43"
}
```

### Example Response
```json
{
  "countryCode": "SE",
  "price": 1200,
  "formatedPrice": "12",
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

### Use case
Perfect for checkout. This api call confirms the price validity for the selected country and rule, so no surprises when it's time to pay.

**Tip:** Always verify pricing server-side before charging to avoid manipulation from the client side.
