title: 'Verify Price'
openapi: 'POST /pricing/verify'
---

### Use case
Use this endpoint when someoneâ€™s ready to pay. It double-checks the pricing rule (using the `ruleId` you got earlier from the `GET /pricing` api endpoint) and returns the **actual amount** you should charge. It helps to keep things accurate.

<Note>
    This is a server-side call and needs your **secret key** to work. Keep it safe!
</Note>

### Authentication
Make sure to include the `Authorization` header:
```http
Authorization: taag_sk_xxxxxxxxx
```

### Request body
```json
{
  "countryCode": "SE",
  "ruleId": "cmb6mqodq000139dsl35qnn43"
}
```

<ResponseField name="countryCode" type="string" required>
Include the country code where the user is in.

Example: `"US"`

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="ruleId" type="string" required>
Include the rule id on which the user is on too.

Example: `"cmb6mqodq000139dsl35qnn43"`

</ResponseField>

> **Note:** Just to be clear here, you get the countryCode and ruleId the in the [Get price](./get) api endpoint

### Response
```json
{
  "countryCode": "SE",
  "price": 1200,
  "formatedPrice": "12",
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

Perfect for checkout. This api call confirms the price validity for the selected country and rule, so no surprises when it's time to pay.

> **Tip:** Always verify pricing server-side before charging to avoid manipulation from the client side.
