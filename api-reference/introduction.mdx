## Base URL

Our pricing API is built on REST principles keeping things smooth and reliable. HTTPS is mandatory on every request. (No HTTP allowed here!)

All your requests start with this base URL:

```bash
https://taag-api.carllabs.cc
```

## Authentication

To get going, just add an Authorization header to your request. Here, `taag_xxxxxxxxx` is your unique key and it should look like this:

Public key
```bash
Authorization: taag_pk_xxxxxxxxx
```

Secret key
```bash
Authorization: taag_sk_xxxxxxxxx
```

<Note>
  Keep it safe and donâ€™t share it around!
