## Base URL

All your requests start with this base URL:

```bash
https://taag-api.carllabs.cc
```

## Authorization

To get going, just add an Authorization header to your request. Always include your `Secret key` in all server-side calls and `Public key` in client-side (like browser) calls. 


**Public key** looks like this
```bash
Authorization: taag_pk_xxxxxxxxx
```

**Secret key** looks like this
```bash
Authorization: taag_sk_xxxxxxxxx
```

<Warning>
  Keep your **secret key** safe and donâ€™t share it around!

## API Endpoints

So why not integrate now and set prices smartly while building products that scale.
